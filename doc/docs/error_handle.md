## Configuration

???+ question "An error appeared during the installation of the 'requirements.txt' file"
    Try using one of the following specific Python versions in the virtual environment: **3.10.1**,  **3.11.0**, **3.13.0**. 
    If the error persists, open an issue in the project's repository.

???+ question "I installed the correct version of DWSIM, but the code can't seem to find it"
    If it's a fresh install, try opening it once, running and saving a simple project, then try the code again. 
    If not, check if the code is being run by the user whose account contains the DWSIM folder in the _AppData_ directory.
