## Calorific Value

**Definition:**  
The calorific value (also known as heating value) is a measure of the amount of energy contained in a fuel or gas. It is expressed in kilojoules per hour (kJ/h).

**Filter Operation Purpose:**  
This filter is used to select or process gas streams based on their energy content, always choosing the stream with the highest calorific value.

## CO₂ and H₂S Fraction

**Definition:**  
This filter considers the combined fraction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in a stream.

**Filter Operation Purpose:**  
This filter is designed to select the gas stream with the highest CO₂ content and the one with the highest H₂S content. If the two streams have similar molecular weights, they are combined into a single stream.

## CO₂ Fraction

**Definition:**  
The carbon dioxide (CO₂) fraction refers to the proportion of CO₂ in a gas mixture, expressed as molar fraction.

**Filter Operation Purpose:**  
This filter is used to evaluate and select samples based solely on their CO₂ concentration, always choosing the one with the highest CO₂ content.
