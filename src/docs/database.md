## Update Heat of Combustion Database

To add new compounds into the combustion database, insert the compound name and heat of combustion value on the [insert_database.py](/src/misc/insert_to_database.py). The compound will be added directly on the [heat_of_combustion.db](/files/database/heat_of_combustion.db).
