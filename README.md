A tool for filtering scenarios and performing flash calculations with **DWSIM** integration. It allows users to analyze scenarios based on predefined criteria, providing a structured and efficient way to flash multiple components.

## Instalation

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Safe-Solutions-Engenharia/filtercomp.git
cd src
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Download and install the latest version of DWSIM.
2. Generate an `.xlsx` file similar to [composicao_teste.xlsx](/tests/composicao_teste.xlsx), ensuring it contains the necessary data for analysis.
3. Open and modify [global_variables.py](/src/config/global_variables.py) as needed to match the desired output.
4. Execute the main script.
5. Retrieve the output folder, which should resemble [Overall](/tests/Overall/).

## Features

- Automatic flashing of multiple currents with various compounds.
- Filtering currents using specific, unique methods.
- Clean and structured data output from the analysis.
